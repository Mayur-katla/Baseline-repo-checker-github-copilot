# Baseline Repo Checker â€” Documentation

Welcome to the Baseline Repo Checker documentation. This guide consolidates setup, usage, API, features, and examples to help you get productive quickly.

- See `SETUP.md` for environment and installation steps.
- See `USER_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step usage of the app.
- See `API_REFERENCE.md` for backend endpoints and formats.
- See `FEATURES.md` for a detailed overview of supported analyses.
- See `USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` for CLI and API examples.

If you run into issues, enable verbose logs on the backend (`NODE_ENV=development`) and check the Summary Log section in the UI; it persists to the database for later review.
